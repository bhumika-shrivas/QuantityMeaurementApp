# 📏 Quantity Measurement App

## 📌 Overview

The Quantity Measurement App compares two quantities (such as length, weight, etc.) and provides comparison across different units.

The application will progressively add:
- 🔄 Conversion from one unit to another  
- ➕ Support for quantity arithmetic  

This app is being developed incrementally. Each use case defines a specific scope, and development must strictly follow that scope.
